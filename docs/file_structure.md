For a project with a separate frontend and backend, here's a common and effective structure:

```
availability-sharer/
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/               # Static assets (index.html, favicons, images)
│   │   └── index.html        # Main HTML file for your SPA (Single Page Application)
│   ├── src/                  # Frontend source code
│   │   ├── assets/           # Static assets like images, fonts, if not in public
│   │   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components (e.g., Calendar.js, TimezoneSelector.js)
│   │   ├── services/         # Modules for making API calls (e.g., apiService.js)
│   │   ├── styles/           # Global styles, CSS variables, etc. (e.g., main.css)
│   │   ├── utils/            # Utility functions (e.g., date formatters)
│   │   ├── App.js            # Main application component (or equivalent for your chosen framework)
│   │   └── main.js           # Entry point for the frontend application (or index.js)
│   ├── package.json          # Frontend dependencies and scripts (npm/yarn)
│   ├── .gitignore            # Git ignore specific to frontend (e.g., node_modules)
│   └── README.md             # Frontend specific setup and run instructions
│
├── backend/
│   ├── app/                  # Your main Python application code
│   │   ├── __init__.py       # Makes 'app' a Python package
│   │   ├── main.py           # API endpoint definitions (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI)
│   │   ├── services/         # Business logic (e.g., availability_formatter.py, timezone_converter.py)
│   │   ├── models/           # Pydantic models for request/response validation (if using FastAPI)
│   │   └── utils/            # Backend utility functions
│   ├── tests/                # Backend unit and integration tests
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── test_api.py
│   ├── venv/                 # Python virtual environment (or .venv) - should be in .gitignore
│   ├── requirements.txt      # Backend Python dependencies
│   ├── .gitignore            # Git ignore specific to backend (e.g., venv, __pycache__)
│   └── README.md             # Backend specific setup and run instructions
│
├── .git/                     # Git repository data (hidden)
├── .gitignore                # Global git ignore file (for editor configs, OS files, etc.)
└── README.md                 # Main project README (overview, how to run both F/E & B/E)
```

**Explanation of Key Directories:**

*   **`availability-sharer/` (Root Folder):**
    *   Contains both your `frontend` and `backend` projects.
    *   The global `.gitignore` should include common ignores like OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) and potentially IDE/editor configuration folders (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`).
    *   The main `README.md` provides an overview of the entire project, how to get both frontend and backend running, and any high-level architectural notes.

*   **`frontend/`:**
    *   **`public/`**: Holds static assets that are served directly by the webserver, like your main `index.html`, favicon, and manifest files.
    *   **`src/`**: This is where your actual frontend application code lives.
        *   **`assets/`**: For images, fonts, etc., that are imported and processed by your build tool.
        *   **`components/`**: Individual, reusable UI pieces (e.g., a Calendar view, a Timezone Dropdown). If using a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte, this is standard.
        *   **`services/`**: Modules dedicated to interacting with your backend API. This helps keep API logic separate from UI components.
        *   **`styles/`**: Global stylesheets, CSS variables, or preprocessor (Sass/Less) files.
        *   **`utils/`**: Helper functions that don't fit elsewhere (e.g., formatting dates, validating inputs).
        *   **`App.js` (or `App.vue`, `App.svelte` etc.)**: Typically the root component of your application.
        *   **`main.js` (or `index.js`)**: The entry point where your frontend application is initialized and mounted to the DOM.
    *   **`package.json`**: Manages your frontend project's dependencies (like React, Vue, a calendar library, Axios for HTTP requests) and defines scripts (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run build`).
    *   **`.gitignore`**: Specific to the frontend, e.g., `node_modules/`, `dist/` (build output).

*   **`backend/`:**
    *   **`app/`**: The core Python package for your backend application.
        *   **`main.py` (or `routes.py`, `views.py`)**: Defines your API endpoints using Flask, FastAPI, or another framework. This is where you'll handle incoming requests and send responses.
        *   **`services/`**: Contains the business logic. For your tool, this would include the Python function that takes the JSON input, performs timezone conversions, and formats the text output.
        *   **`models/`**: If using a framework like FastAPI, this is where you'd define Pydantic models for request body validation and response serialization. Even without FastAPI, you might have simple data classes here.
        *   **`utils/`**: Backend-specific utility functions.
    *   **`tests/`**: For your backend tests (unit tests, integration tests).
    *   **`venv/` (or `.venv`)**: The Python virtual environment folder. This should *definitely* be in your backend's `.gitignore` (and ideally the global one too).
    *   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies for your backend (e.g., Flask, pytz). You generate this with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
    *   **`.gitignore`**: Specific to the backend, e.g., `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env` files.

**Benefits of this Structure:**

*   **Clear Separation:** Frontend and backend concerns are distinctly isolated, making it easier to work on one without affecting the other.
*   **Independent Development:** Frontend and backend teams (or you, switching hats) can work more independently.
*   **Scalability:** Easier to scale or replace one part (e.g., rewrite the frontend with a new framework) without a full rewrite of the other.
*   **Technology Agnostic:** The frontend doesn't care what language/framework the backend uses, and vice-versa, as long as they communicate via the defined API contract.
*   **Organized Dependencies:** Each part has its own dependency management (`package.json` for frontend, `requirements.txt` for backend).

This structure provides a solid foundation for your local development. You can initialize a Git repository in the `availability-sharer/` root directory.
